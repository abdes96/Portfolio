                    <p >
                      Hello! I'm Abdeslam Boutaarourt, a dedicated Full-Stack Developer with a
                      passion for crafting digital solutions that make a difference. Currently
                      in my third and final year at Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel, studying
                      Multimedia & Creative Technology, I'm on an exciting journey to expand
                      my horizons and delve deeper into the world of technology.

              <div id="textUsercentric">
                <div>
                  <p>
                    My approach to development is driven by a deep desire to create user-centric experiences that not only meet but exceed expectations. I believe that technology should be a tool for positive change, and I'm excited to contribute my skills to projects that align with this philosophy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outside of coding, you can often find me exploring new tech trends, collaborating on open-source projects, or simply enjoying a good cup of coffee while brainstorming innovative solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm enthusiastic about every project I undertake, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to grow and learn in this ever-evolving field. Whether you're interested in collaborating, discussing tech trends, or just connecting, feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always up for a good tech conversation!

                    I have worked on a number of projects, ranging from small personal projects to larger collaborative efforts. These projects have allowed me to gain hands-on experience and further develop my skills.
